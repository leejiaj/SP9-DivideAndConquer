CS 5V81 SP 9: Divide and conquer algorithms

Leejia James and Nirbhay Sibal

Team task:
1. Implemented and compared the running times of the following algorithms
   on randomly generated arrays: (a) Insertion sort, (b) Merge sort (take 1),
   (c) Merge sort (take 2), (d) Merge sort (take 3).

How to Compile:
1. Unzip contents of lxj171130.zip into a folder named "lxj171130".
2. Run the command `javac lxj171130/*.java` to compile.
3. Run the command `java lxj171130.SP9 <n> <choice>` to execute the program.

where,
n - Number of elements the array
choice - 1, 2, 3 or 4
	1 for Insertion sort
	2 for Merge sort (take 1)
	3 for Merge sort (take 2)
	4 for Merge sort (take 3)
